# Rhino Linux Roadmap

Rhino Linux utilises a rolling roadmap. This means that our roadmap will be continually updated as new features are developed.

<Callout type="info" emoji="✎">
  **Note:** Our roadmap will **often** not include changes to Pacstall as Pacstall follows a different release cycle to Rhino Linux.

## Releases

### Development Cycle
Rhino Linux runs in development sprints. Here is what that looks like:
- Planning phase
- Development phase
- Release Candidate phase
- Release

In the planning phase we will look at our GitHub issues, ask for community feedback and reflect on what we wish to see come out of Rhino Linux, and then we will begin to build the roadmap for the next release.

Once the development phase is in full swing, features that are developed will land in Rhino Linux once they are complete. Users who have installed the distribution will only need to update to recieve a change, rather than wait for our next disk image release.

The Release Candidate phase is where we slow down on feature development for Rhino Linux. Don't worry, your packages will still be continually updated just as if you were using Arch! From here we will begin to test our disk images, and apply fixes where necessary. During this phase other preperations for release: such as updating documentation, writing blog posts and announcements will be underway.

Release! The last 2 days of release are usually the most stressful. We begin our final tests, upload to the mirror, and merge the website updated with links and the appropriate blog post. A message will go out on subreddits, and the team can rest for a few days, before we start the cycle all over again.
