# Creating Hotfixes

This page is a guide overviewing how to create and push hotfixes for the [Rhino Hotfix](https://github.com/rhino-linux/hotfix) utility.

## Built-in Variables

| Variable Name | Purpose | Value | Notes |
|---------------|---------|-------|-------|
| `SRCDIR` | Staging area for hotfixes | `/tmp/rhino-hotfix/${hotfix}-${published}` | Useful if scripts need to `cd` to locations and return back later |
| `CARCH`  | Current architecture running | `$(dpkg --print-architecture)` | Useful if scripts require downloads or perform actions based on architecture |

## Standards

Hotfix scripts should conform to the following standards:

### Bash Shebang
The top of the script should always start with an `env bash` shebang:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
```

### Hotfix Function
All script actions should be contained within functions, with the main function always called `hotfix`:
```bash
hotfix() {
  echo "This is a hotfix."
}
```

### Localize Everything
All variables should be localized within the functions:
```bash
hotfix() {
  local names=("test1" "test2")

  for i in "${names[@]}"; do
    echo "${i}"
  done
}
```
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠">
  **Warning:** Do not localize `SRCDIR` or `CARCH`, or they will be made inaccessible to the script.
</Callout>
<Callout type="error" emoji="⛌">
  **Danger:** Do not `export` any variables.
</Callout>

### Cleanup Extra Functions
If using extra functions, be sure to clean them up with `unset -f` at the end of the `hotfix` function:
```bash
hotfix() {
  local names=("test1" "test2")

  for i in "${names[@]}"; do
    subprocess "${i}"
  done
  unset -f subprocess
}

subprocess() {
  echo "${1}"
}
```
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠">
  **Warning:** This is crucial, as if these are not unset, they could bleed over into other scripts.
</Callout>

### Example Script
Putting it all together, here is what a hotfix script might look like:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

hotfix() {
  local names messages
  names=("test1" "test2")
  messages=("This is the first message" "This is the second")

  for i in "${!names[@]}"; do
    subprocess "${names[i]}" "${messages[i]}"
  done
  unset -f subprocess
}

subprocess() {
  local name="${1}" message="${2}"
  echo "${name}: ${message}"
}
```

## Adding and Publishing
Once written, the hotfix script must follow these guidelines:
1. It must be placed in the `scripts/` directory of the [Rhino Hotfix](https://github.com/rhino-linux/hotfix) repository.
2. While the name of the script can be flexible, it must be relevant to the thing it is fixing.
3. The name of the script must end with the suffix `.sh`.

Then, from the head of the repository, run:
```bash
go run manager.go add -t HOTFIXNAME -d "Some description" -s scripts/SCRIPTNAME.sh
git add hotfixes.json scripts/SCRIPTNAME.sh
```
<Callout emoji="ⓘ">
  **Important:** `HOTFIXNAME` can only use the following characters: `[A-z]`, `[0-9]`, `[-~._+()]`
</Callout>
<Callout type="info" emoji="✎">
  **Note:** `HOTFIXNAME` and `SCRIPTNAME` do not necessarily need to match. `HOTFIXNAME` will be what is called to run the hotfix (`rhino-hotfix HOTFIXNAME`).
</Callout>
