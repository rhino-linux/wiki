## How to get started building Rhino Linux images

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠">
  **Warning:** This can only be built with the latest release of Ubuntu and derivatives such as Rhino Linux!
</Callout>

<Callout emoji="ⓘ">
  **Important:** Looking how to do release builds? look at [building using Github Actions](./github-actions)
</Callout>

### Instructions

First, make sure the proper dependencies are installed:
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install --reinstall debootstrap mtools dosfstools qemu-user-static binfmt-support dpkg-dev git
```

The repository can be cloned into by Git (defaulting to the generic branch):

  **Important:** Depending on the target, clone either the `rpi`, `pinetab`, or `pinephone` branch instead.
</Callout>
```
git clone https://github.com/rhino-linux/os.git && cd ./os
```

Next, to install the live build dependency:
```
sudo dpkg -i debs/live-build_*_all.deb
```

Unfortunately, live-build has to be patched to support Ubuntu `devel` archives so multiple commands have to be run:
```
sudo mv /usr/share/debootstrap/functions functions && sudo patch -i 0002-remove-WRONGSUITE-error.patch && sudo mv functions /usr/share/debootstrap/functions && sudo cp binary_grub-efi /usr/lib/live/build/binary_grub-efi
```

The last step to get the repository running is making the scripts executable:
```
chmod -R +x build.sh etc/auto/config etc/terraform.conf etc/
```

Finally, images can be made:
```
sudo ./build.sh etc/terraform.conf
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="✎">
  **Note:** Images can be rebuilt using `sudo ./build.sh etc/terraform.conf`
</Callout>

The resulting image to flash is found under `builds/[architecture]` where `[architecture]` is either `amd64` or `arm64`.
The in addition, an SHA256 and SHA512 checksum is created to verify.
