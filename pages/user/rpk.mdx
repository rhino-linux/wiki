# Rhino PKG

Rhino PKG (command: `rhino-pkg`, symlink: `rpk`) is our custom meta-package manager. It was designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind. It will allow for you to search, install, remove and upgrade packages from all of our supported package manager repositories.

<Callout emoji="ⓘ">
  **Important:** We strongly urge users to use Rhino PKG instead of each package manager individually.
</Callout>

### Supported package managers
- APT
- Pacstall
- Flatpak
- Snapcraft

<Callout type="info" emoji="✎">
  **Note:** Rhino PKG will only interact with package managers installed on the system.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠">
  **Warning:** Rhino PKG does not handle repositories within package managers. To specifically select from repositories, use the appropriate individual command (e.g. `sudo snap install --edge` for Edge snaps or `sudo flatpak install flathub-beta` for beta flatpaks.)
