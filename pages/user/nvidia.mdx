# Install Nvidia Drivers

Nvidia driver installation on Rhino Linux is fairly straightforward. To install Nvidia drivers, just run the following command:
```bash
rpk install nvidia-dkms
```

This will list multiple version options to install. If you do not know which one will work best for you, check [Nvidia's website](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx).

On some older laptops, you may also need Primus libraries.
```bash
rpk install primus-nvidia
```

If you would prefer to use the binary installers, which are sometimes more up-to-date than the DKMS modules provided in APT, three packages are provided by Pacstall:
1. `nvidia-prod-installer`, from the driver's production branch
2. `nvidia-feat-installer`, from the driver's new feature branch
3. `nvidia-beta-installer`, from the driver's beta branch
