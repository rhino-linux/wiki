# Replacing Unicorn (XFCE)

Maybe you're not a fan of XFCE, and would like to keep the same Unicorn elegance, but with a different desktop as a base. UBXI makes that possible.

To search for a UBXI port you can simply run:
```bash
rpk install ubxi
```
From here you can see which desktop environment ports are available and select to install one, such as `ubxi-kde-desktop-git`. To switch to any generic desktop environment available in normal repositories (GNOME, KDE, etc), select just `rhino-ubxi-core` (or install `rhino-server-core` to opt-out of our GUI utilities).

<Callout emoji="â“˜">
  **Important:** Make sure you've installed an environment before moving on to the next step!
</Callout>

Afterwards, you will safely be able to run `rpk remove unicorn-desktop-git` (or `unicorn-mobile-git`).

UBXI is entirely community maintained, and then is verified by Rhino Linux developers. If a port does not exist that you want, you are free to look at our [UBXI creation/development page](../dev/ubxi/create).
